**Analyzing Mental Health on Reddit**

This project investigates linguistic patterns in mental health communities on Reddit by combining classical data mining techniques (TF-IDF, clustering, graph analysis) with modern approaches (BERT embeddings, contextualized topic modeling). Our goal is to understand how mental health discourse differs from general conversation and build interpretable models while maintaining ethical safeguards.
